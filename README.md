## Thistle Farms 2016 Holiday Fund Raising Page

This is a pro-bono project I've done for the last couple of years for the charitable organization Thistle Farms in Nashville, TN. Thistle Farms is a marketplace for handmade products by women who are survivors of addiction, trafficking, violence, and extreme poverty.

The site is hosted on Shopify so all resources, stylesheets, scripts and markup are all in index.html. There is a nice embedded video, some simple interactive bits to select the donation amount or input _Other_ and a simple `window.open()` call to a campaign page on Kindful.
